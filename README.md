# Currency-Converter
One of my first projects that I'm quite proud of! To build this simple currency converter I used new (at least for me) techniques such as BEM convention in CSS, switch & code refactoring in JS I have added an og image and page icon! Nice for a complete noob in frontend development ;) Wait for my next projects's I'm so excited :D
